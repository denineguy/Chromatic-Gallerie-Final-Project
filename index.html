<p>I have worked in retail industry for over 6 years.  As such, I decided to create a sample E-commerce site as my final project for the Front End Web Development course at General Assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Year:</strong>  2013 <br><strong>Vertical:</strong>   Retail/E-Commerce <br><strong>Project Scope:</strong>  Front-End Development, User Experience <br><strong>Project Responsibilities:</strong>  Template coding/front-end programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.)</p>

<h3>
<a name="site-features" class="anchor" href="#site-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Site Features</h3>

<p>The focus of the project was on the user experience, creating a clean site with key features to make browsing easier for the customer.</p>

<ul>
<li>The site contains fixed navigation allowing the user to access different pages, within the site, with minimal vertical scrolling.</li>
<li>The video section on the "Home" page offers a hidden division that opens when the video is played.  This keeps the page clean and simple. </li>
<li>The "Home" page offers animated vertical scrolling when the menus options "How It Works","About Us", or "New Product Releases" are clicked.  This helps the customer get to the information they are looking for quicker.</li>
<li>The "Shop" page offers a scrolling navigation bar that turns fixed when it hits the top of the page.  This offers the retailer a hero-image section to showcase key products, while also allowing the customers the ability to easily filter product selections with minimal scrolling. On most site the filter options are not a fixed navigation forcing to scroll to the top of the page to change filter options.</li>
<li>The "Shop" page offers the option to view 3 images per row or 6 images per row.  This provides a way to show more items per page while minimizing the amount of vertical scrolling and decreasing number of product pages. </li>
<li>The product detail page was designed to offer a clean and easy to read interface with ability to access more information if and when the user deems necessary. (*Note to access the product detail page the user must click on the "Blue Crush on You" pump.)</li>
<li>The submit button on the "Create Account" page validates if the customer enters their account information correctly</li>
</ul>
